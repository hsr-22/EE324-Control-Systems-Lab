1) Read the problem statement.

2) Read the setup's manual (PendulumSetup_manual.pdf).

3) The matrix parameter values are given in the manual, use them to calculate the elements of the state space matrices (A, B, C and D).

4) Using these matrices, run the LQR program in MATLAB and get the gain values (K1, K2, K3 and K4) by tuning the Q matrix.

5) Use them, along with the state variables to realize the control input to the motor.


6) Sample Arduino code for interfacing encoder with arduino and reading the encoder values is provided in the same folder.
